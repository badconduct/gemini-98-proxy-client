ICQ98 Proxy is a nostalgic chat simulator that brings 90s internet social life back to your desktop. It's a multi-user, password-protected application with AI-powered friends, an in-browser buddy list, and full compatibility with retro browsers. It feels like you're back on dial-up... but the conversations are way smarter.

## üß† Features

- **Secure, File-Based Profiles:** No more cookies for state. Every user has a password-protected profile saved securely on the server.
- **Multi-Profile Launcher System:** The application starts with a login portal. Log in to an existing account or create a new one. The buddy list then "launches" in a new window.
- **Administrator Role & User Management:** The first user created becomes the prime administrator, who can view all users, grant/revoke admin status, and delete accounts.
- **Advanced Social & Age Dynamics:**
  - **Social Groups:** Friends are organized into distinct groups (Students, Townies/Alumni, Online Friends) with their own social rules.
  - **Dynamic Relationships:** Your age and social group determine your starting relationships with other characters.
  - **Personalized AI:** The AI's personality and behavior change dramatically based on your age, social status, and conversation history.
- **Deep AI Personas:** Chat with over a dozen unique AI friends, each with distinct personalities, interests, and schedules.
- **No Front-End Frameworks:** Works in Netscape 4 or IE6, no webpack, no BS.

## ü§ñ The Social Simulation Engine

The core of the application is a dynamic rules engine that generates unique system instructions for the Gemini API in real-time.

- **Context is King:** The AI is given deep context about your character (age, sex, location, social role) and its own character (personality, interests, relationships with other AIs).
- **Age-Based Logic:** The simulation's rules change based on your age.
  - **Ages 14-19 (Student):** You're an insider with other students, starting with higher relationship scores.
  - **Ages 20-39 (Townie/Alumni):** You have a natural rapport with the other townies.
  - **Ages <=13 or >=40 (Online Friend):** AI friends will be suspicious of you. If you're under 14, they'll become patronizing. If you're over 40, students will find you "creepy" and their opinion of you will permanently decrease with every interaction.
- **Relationship Score:** Your conversations directly impact your relationship score with each friend, unlocking different conversational paths and behaviors.
